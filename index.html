    <p id="abstract">
        Memory curation is critical for preserving culture and identity in migrant communities, yet traditional
        toolsâ€”diaries, photographs, and videosâ€”often fall short in capturing the sensory and emotional depth of
        memory narratives. To address this gap, we developed MomentsVR, an exploratory probe for creating immersive 
        narratives that recreate personal memory places by capturing space and meaning. In a study with 18 participants
        from diverse cultural backgrounds, individuals reconstructed personal memories, cultural celebrations, and
        migration journeys, transforming virtual spaces into personal memory places. Through digital proxy media,
        including voice annotations and photographs, participants added layers of social and cultural significance tied
        to their migration experiences, bridging gaps of missing artifacts. We discuss how these reconstructions reflect
        efforts of feminist history to support alternative narratives, fostering agency for marginalized voices, and
        offer design implications for immersive narratives, reflecting on how virtual environments can serve as
        platforms for reclaiming histories.

        <p>We used the MomentsVR system as an exploratory probe to investigate how immersive storytelling could support
            narratives of migration. Here we present the materials used for this evaluation. For the findings, please
            see the publication.</p>

        <h2>Recruitment</h2>
        <p> We distributed the following recruitment message through various local email and messaging channels: <a

        <h2>Protocol</h2>
        <p> We followed this protocol in conducting the studies. As the interview portions were semi-structured, the
            questions given in the protocol served as guidelines for the direction of questioning: <a
